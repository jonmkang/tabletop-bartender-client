Name: Tabletop Bartender
Live app: [Tabletop Bartender](https://tabletop-bartender-client.vercel.app/)

When downloading tabletop-bartender-client, install all dependencies with npm install.


Once they are installed, you can run the command npm start to run the client locally. 
This will connect to a server I set up on Heroku.  You can create your own database with my server code.

    How to demo the website:

    Active demo user's email: demo@gmail.com
        --This is not an actual email, it is only used for demo purposes.

    Demo user's password: Password1!

This project displays what cocktails I have put into the database and shows how to search through them in a simple manner.  By using a cocktail name or the ingredients you can find out different recipes.  Using the demo user to log in, the user can add cocktails of their own using the ingredients inside the database.

The technologies I used in this project include:
    React
    React Router
    React Select
    Fetch requests
    User Authentication with JWT
